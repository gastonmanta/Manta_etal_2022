Oceanographic dataset of CTD, TSG and ADCP campaign in Uruguay during April-May 2016 (see the paper)

About the data: (Time is always in matlab datenum format)

CTD_Manta_etal_2022.mat contains the 82 CTD profiles

# name 0 = prDM: Pressure, Digiquartz [db]
# name 1 = depSM: Depth [salt water, m]
# name 2 = t090C: Temperature [ITS-90, deg C]
# name 3 = sal00: Salinity, Practical [PSU]
# name 4 = t190C: Temperature, 2 [ITS-90, deg C]
# name 5 = sal11: Salinity, Practical, 2 [PSU]
# name 6 = flECO-AFL: Fluorescence, WET Labs ECO-AFL/FL [mg/m^3]
# name 7 = sbeox0Mg/L: Oxygen, SBE 43 [mg/l]

TSG_Manta_etal_2022.mat is the TSG  data with a 10 minute centered moving averaged and a very coarse calibration of the fluorometer (see the paper)

ADCP_Manta_etal_2022.mat are u and v velocities from the hull munted adcp, matrices of depth (50)xtime(18500) processed with cascade and tide corrected. See the 

Water_samples_Manta_etal_2022.mat contains nutrients. Also, chlorophyll-a at 5m depth.
